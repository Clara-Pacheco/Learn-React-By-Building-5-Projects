# Project 01 - Build a Hero:

Although it may be a simple project with only one component, it showcases a variety of key aspects of React, such as state creation and manipulation. Each state in the project has a different data type - number, string, and boolean.

Furthermore, the project includes input fields that allow users to enter information, which is then stored in a state variable. When the user clicks a button, the state variable 'displayCharacter' is set to true and the stored input data is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

Despite its simplicity, this project effectively demonstrates how React can be used to manage states and dynamically display user input. By utilizing these key concepts, developers can create more complex and dynamic applications that provide a more engaging user experience.
